The main objective of this project is develop a CNN algorithm that differentiates between the different 196 classes using employing Tensorflow and using the standford cars 196 dataset. Some examples of the classes are:

    'Audi TT Hatchback 2011', 
    'Audi S6 Sedan 2011'
    'Audi S5 Convertible 2012', 
    'Audi S5 Coupe 2012'
    'Audi TT RS Coupe 2012', 
    'BMW ActiveHybrid 5 Sedan 2012'
    'BMW 6 Series Convertible 2007', 
    'BMW X5 SUV 2007'

The class description is a combination of the make, model and the year.
